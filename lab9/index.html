                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p> The biggest challenge I faced with this assignment was orngizing the file structure correctly, and insuring that they are all linked correctly, always a problem for me. The JQurey link was confusing but I think I got it eventually. </p>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Problems?</h2>
                <p> I encountered a few issues with the JavaScript code. At first the toggleClass("special") function wasn't working at first because I had a typo </p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p> I learned the importance of setting up a project with a well-organized file structure and the value of using the console for debugging. I became more comfortable with jQuery for adding and toggling classes. This assignment gave me a new importance for testing small peices of code incrimentally.</p>
