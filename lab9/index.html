                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The biggest challenge I faced with this assignment was organizing the file structure correctly and ensuring they are all linked correctly, always a problem for me. The jQuery link was confusing, but I think I got it eventually.</p>

            <div class="minor-section" id="problems">
                <h2>Problems?</h2>
                <p>I encountered a few issues with the JavaScript code. At first, the toggleClass("special") function wasn't working because I had a typo.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section" id="reflection">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>I learned the importance of setting up a project with a well-organized file structure and the value of using the console for debugging. I became more comfortable with jQuery for adding and toggling classes. This assignment gave me a new appreciation for testing small pieces of code incrementally.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section" id="results">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>The final output of the project met the requirements, and I was able to successfully implement the buttons and styling as intended.</p>
