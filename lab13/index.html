            <h1>Lab 13: Loops</h1>
            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>Working with your partner, experiment with loops, try to decifer this damn lab without any pictures of the lab on canvas. It was difficult to know what the outcome should be.</p>
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>A lot of problems arose from this lab, but I was able to (I think) figure it out with the help of AI and WesBot. This lab was only confusing due to the lack of pictrues, I had no idea what the final output was supposed to be. </p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Even though I used AI I think the problem solving of attempting to understand what the AI was doing, and the step by step nature as it walked me thorugh how to complete this lab, I think made me understand it on a better level. I hope this is correct!! Also I hope you enjoy my fun CSS!!! </p>
