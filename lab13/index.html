                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p> The challenge of this lab was to create an interactive webpage that randomly chooses a hogwarts house based on the input in the text field. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section" id="problems">
                <h2>Problems?</h2>
                <p> I didn't have any actual issues with the lab itself, but I did try to get fancy and go above and beyond and thats when I started to have problems. Like I attempted to import a harry potter themed font into css that didn't work, so I had to pivot into different sytling.  </p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section" id="reflection">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>  This was a pretty cool lab, I think the concept is good to learn how to randomisze stuff like this. My group was thinking of making a cookbook website and I could see this lab being applicaple. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section" id="results">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p> I tried to make this as harry potter themed as possible, since i am a nerd. Go Slytherin! </p>
