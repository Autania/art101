			<h1>Lab 3 - Structure File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> This lab is meant to get us to understand how file structure works, and be able to create, link, and format specific pages. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> My first problem that arose was not being able to correctly have the image I wanted in the webpage, to format the way I wanted it to. I solved this by asking my neighbors about images, and they helped me by making a class in css, and by doing so I was able to adjust the size of the image. I also helped my partner do the same thing once I had learned it!  </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I think this assignment went really well. I understand how to format files, and it wasn't too much extra learning. Since I spent the first two labs relly attempting to understand what I was doing with this reposatory, it went much more smoothly. I care about this assignment a lot so I put a lot of effort into it. I even learned how to put in multiple pictures, and continue to edit my homepage with css, and discover new elements of code that I can use for this assignment and future assignments! </p>
