                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p> This lab had a few challenges like Making sure that the jQuery is loaded (I still don't understand this very well but I feel more confident after this lab) This also involved more stylign with css, which I actually find that I love doing! css is a really fun program to mess around with, and theres a million and one sources online to help style things how you want them.  </p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section" id="problems">
                <h2>Problems?</h2>
                <p>I think I understood the assignment pretyy well, its definetly a bigger issue actually exectuing the task vs undertsanding but I hope I did it right! I didn't run into many problems, but I did have the slightly bit of help from my CS friends. This was the first lab where everything linked correctly the first time wohoo! </p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section" id="reflection">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p> My main takeaway from this lab is defining that I really feel comfortable with CSS. I think I like how many resources there are for helping with styling choices. For example I did the BONUS TASK X, and I was able to make the bubbles of random generated text look like iMessage bubbles! Pretty cool!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section" id="results">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p> I think it looks pretty cool, I'm less comfortable with javascript, and more comfortable with CSS! </p>
